4:Tb9d,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I start learning day trading?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The best way to start learning day trading is by combining foundational technical analysis education with intensive paper trading (simulated trading). Beginners should master chart reading, risk management, and market psychology before risking real capital. Using a high-speed simulator like ScrollStreet allows you to practice on real historical data, helping you recognize profitable patterns 10x faster than traditional live-market waiting."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How risky is day trading?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Day trading is highly risky, especially for beginners. The volatility of the stock and crypto markets means you can lose your entire capital quickly if you do not use strict stop-loss orders and proper risk management. To mitigate this risk, successful traders build their strategies in risk-free environments. Simulating trades on past data lets you test the risk without the financial loss."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is day trading gambling or skill?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Day trading is gambling if you trade on emotion without a tested system. It is a skill when executed using a defined trading strategy, strict risk management, and recognized statistical edges. Building this skill requires 'screen time.' ScrollStreet turns trading into a skill-based practice by giving you instant feedback on your decisions using real market history."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why do 90% of day traders lose money?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Statistically, 90% of day traders lose money because of emotional decision-making, over-leveraging, and a lack of market experience. Most beginners enter the live market too soon. They lack the muscle memory to react to price action correctly. Consistent profitability requires repetition, which is why practicing thousands of trades on a simulator is critical before going live."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the biggest mistake day traders make?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The biggest mistake day traders make is revenge trading after a loss and failing to cut losses early. This stems from a lack of confidence in their strategy. ScrollStreet's 'Smart Feedback' engine fixes this by summarizing exactly why a trade failed, helping you learn from mistakes instantly instead of repeating them in live markets."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it true that 99% of day traders fail?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"While the exact number fluctuates, studies show that roughly 85% to 95% of retail day traders are not consistently profitable. The few who succeed treat trading like a high-performance sport. They train constantly, analyze their historical performance, and refine their edge through continuous simulated practice."}}]}0:{"P":null,"b":"tb86G0a38XYFDABBeo_IX","c":["","learn-day-trading"],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["learn-day-trading",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/063a1bff9de215b0.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"inter_5901b7c6-module__ec5Qua__variable playfair_display_dc3b86c2-module__wRxeBG__variable font-sans bg-[#0A0A0A] text-white antialiased","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$4"}}],"$L5"],["$L6","$L7"],"$L8"]}],{},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false],"$L9",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$a",[]],"S":true}
